# Name of the workflow
name: Correct CI Pipeline

# This workflow is designed to run tests on the corrected
# test_script_corrected.py
# It verifies that the code functions as expected without errors.

# Define the events that trigger the workflow
on:
  # Trigger the workflow on pushes to the 'main' branch
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  # Trigger the workflow on pull requests targeting the 'main' branch
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

# Define the jobs that will run as part of this workflow
jobs:
  build:
    # Specify the operating system for the job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Define the steps to execute in this job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the code from the repository
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        # This action checks out the repository under
        # $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so the workflow can access it.

      # Step 2: Set up the Python environment
      - name: Set Up Python Environment
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          # Specify the version of Python to use for the environment
          python-version: "3.9" # Replace with the desired Python version

      # Step 3: Install project dependencies
      - name: Install Project Dependencies
        run: |
          # Upgrade pip to ensure we have the 
          # latest package management tools
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          # Install pytest, a testing framework 
          # that we'll use to run our test scripts
          pip install pytest

      # Step 4: Execute tests using pytest
      - name: Run Tests
        run: |
          # Execute the tests defined in the test_script_error.py script.
          # Run the tests defined in the corrected test_script_corrected.py script.
          # This script is expected to 
          # contain passing tests to ensure that 
          # the code is functioning correctly.
          pytest test_script_corrected.py  
          # Execute tests in the specified test script
